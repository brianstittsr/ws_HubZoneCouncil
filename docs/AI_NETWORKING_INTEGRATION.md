## Automation & Scheduling

### Recommended Cron Jobs

1. **Daily Low Activity Detection**
   - Run: Every day at 9 AM
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/ai/networking/detect-low-activity`
   - Purpose: Generate alerts for inactive affiliates

2. **Weekly Match Refresh**
   - Run: Every Monday at 8 AM
   - Purpose: Regenerate AI match recommendations for all affiliates

3. **Monthly Leaderboard Update**
   - Run: First day of month at midnight
   - Purpose: Recalculate rankings and award achievements

---

## AI Model Configuration

### OpenAI Settings

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for:
- Match insights generation
- Meeting summary enhancement
- Talking points suggestions
- Synergy identification

**Configuration:**
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Temperature: 0.5-0.7 (balanced creativity)
- Max tokens: 150-300 (concise responses)
- Response format: JSON for structured data

**API Key Setup:**
1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, OR
2. Configure in Firebase Platform Settings → LLM Config

---

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- **Match recommendations:** Cache for 24 hours per affiliate
- **Profile data:** Cache for 1 hour
- **Alert checks:** Real-time, no caching

### Rate Limiting

- AI API calls are rate-limited to prevent excessive usage
- Batch processing for multiple affiliates
- Fallback to cached data if API unavailable

### Cost Optimization

- Use GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency
- Limit token usage with concise prompts
- Cache AI-generated content
- Only regenerate when profiles change

---

## Error Handling

All AI endpoints include graceful fallbacks:

1. **API Unavailable:** Return cached or default recommendations
2. **Invalid Input:** Return validation errors with helpful messages
3. **Timeout:** Return partial results with timeout indicator
4. **Rate Limit:** Queue requests and retry with exponential backoff

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test recommendations
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/networking/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"affiliateId":"test123","limit":3}'

# Test summary enhancement
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/networking/enhance-summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rawNotes":"Met with John. Discussed ISO cert needs."}'

# Test activity detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/networking/detect-low-activity
```

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze meeting notes for relationship quality
2. **Predictive Scoring:** Predict referral success likelihood
3. **Auto-Scheduling:** AI suggests optimal meeting times
4. **Smart Follow-ups:** Automated follow-up reminders based on context
5. **Network Graph Analysis:** Visualize connection opportunities
6. **Multi-language Support:** Translate summaries and recommendations

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** AI recommendations return empty array
- **Solution:** Ensure networking profiles are complete for both users

**Issue:** Meeting enhancement fails
- **Solution:** Check OpenAI API key configuration and quota

**Issue:** Alerts not generating
- **Solution:** Verify affiliate stats are being updated after meetings

### Logs

All AI operations are logged with:
- Request parameters
- Processing time
- Error details (if any)
- Token usage

Check server logs for debugging: `console.log` statements in API routes.

---

## Security

- API endpoints require authentication
- Affiliate data is scoped to user permissions
- AI-generated content is sanitized
- PII is not sent to external AI services without consent
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables

---

## Compliance

- GDPR: Users can request deletion of AI-generated data
- Data retention: AI matches expire after 30 days
- Audit trail: All AI operations are logged
- Transparency: Users can see why they were matched
