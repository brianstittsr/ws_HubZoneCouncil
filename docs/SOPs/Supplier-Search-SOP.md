## 2. Contact Enrichment (Apollo.io)

### 2.1 Overview

Apollo.io is used to find and reveal contact information (emails and phone numbers) for decision-makers at supplier companies.

### 2.2 Searching for Contacts

1. Navigate to **Portal → Apollo Search**
2. Enter search criteria:
   - **Keywords** (e.g., "Purchasing Manager")
   - **Company name**
   - **Location**
   - **Industry**
3. Click **Search**

### 2.3 Revealing Contact Information

#### Email Reveal
1. Find a contact in search results
2. Click the **Email** button (envelope icon)
3. The system will:
   - First check Apollo's saved contacts (FREE - no credits used)
   - If not found, use `people/enrich` endpoint (USES CREDITS)
4. Email is displayed and saved to your list

#### Phone Reveal
1. Find a contact in search results
2. Click the **Phone** button (phone icon)
3. The system will:
   - First check Apollo's saved contacts (FREE - no credits used)
   - If not found, use `people/enrich` endpoint (USES CREDITS)
4. Phone number is displayed and saved to your list

### 2.4 Credit-Saving Strategy

The SVP Platform is optimized to minimize credit usage:

1. **Saved Contacts Check** - Before spending credits, the system checks if the contact was previously enriched in Apollo's saved contacts database
2. **Firebase Caching** - Revealed data is stored in Firebase, so re-accessing the same contact doesn't use additional credits
3. **Batch Operations** - Plan your enrichment to avoid duplicate lookups

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1 Minimize Credit Usage

1. **Check saved contacts first** - The system does this automatically
2. **Use saved lists** - Avoid re-revealing the same contacts
3. **Batch your searches** - Plan enrichment campaigns in advance
4. **Prioritize high-value contacts** - Focus on decision-makers

### 4.2 Optimize Search Results

1. **Use specific keywords** - "CNC machining" vs just "machining"
2. **Add location filters** - Narrow results by region
3. **Include certifications** - "ISO 9001", "AS9100", etc.
4. **Specify company size** - Filter by employee count

### 4.3 Data Quality

1. **Verify contact info** - Apollo data may be outdated
2. **Cross-reference** - Check LinkedIn profiles
3. **Update regularly** - Re-enrich contacts periodically
4. **Report errors** - Flag incorrect data in Apollo

## 5. Troubleshooting

### 5.1 "Email/Phone Not Available"

**Possible causes:**
- Contact not in Apollo's database
- Data not yet enriched
- API key restrictions (some endpoints require higher-tier plans)

**Solutions:**
1. Try searching by LinkedIn URL
2. Check if contact exists in Apollo directly
3. Verify API key permissions

### 5.2 "API Inaccessible"

**Cause:** The `people/enrich` endpoint requires a paid Apollo plan

**Solution:** 
- Upgrade to a paid Apollo plan
- Use the `contacts/search` endpoint for already-saved contacts (free)

### 5.3 Slow Search Results

**Cause:** ThomasNet scraping takes time

**Solution:**
- Wait for results to load (first search may take 5-10 seconds)
- Use more specific search terms to reduce result set

### 5.4 Missing Supplier Data

**Cause:** ThomasNet may block automated requests

**Solution:**
- Retry the search
- Use category-based search instead of keyword search
- Check ThomasNet directly for comparison
